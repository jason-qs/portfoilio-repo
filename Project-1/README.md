 ## Project #1

https://github.com/jason-qs/Movie-theater-web-app

 Overview
 - This is a backend REST application built with spring boot and Java connected to a MySql database

 - The use of this project is to have a movie reservation management system that can handle user's reservations, and allows users to make reservations

 - Some important features are the ability of the project the ability to safely create users and save them into the databse. Also having users create reservations to movies into specific theaters.

## Competencies

### JF 2.1-2.8 : Take a Businees or User problem, gather data to analyze the problem and use prototyping tools to create a high fidelity wireframe and UI framework, test the application, and use agile project management

- I demonstrated this job function while working on a prototype in American Express for a specific application to verify that a database migration was successfully completed. The steps I took were to figure out the user needs and technical requirements, create a mockup wireframe of the UI, and build a prototype of the project built with React.
- The result of my actions were increased competency in what steps are required in solving a business problem, as well as a prototype that showcases a solution that will help American Express solve a business problem
- This competency is connected to this project because I analyzed the user's needs and created a practical solution.


### JF 3.1-3.8 : 3.1-3.8 : Apply the process of server-side development, including explaining algorithms, logic and data structures, can develop and maintain databases and codebases, and explain and implement APIs
- I demonstrated this job function in this specific project as well during my employment at American Express. I worked on multiple server-side projects where I worked with codebases of varying sizes as well as different databases. In these projects, I had to connect to different Rest APIs, make sure data was encrypted, and use the proper data structures and logic to safely handle all the data
- The result of my actions was a meaningful contribution to my team and company. I also gained experience working with large codebases, server-side logic, and how encryption works
- This competency is connected to this project because I built a Spring boot backend that is able to safely created, read, update, and delete data from the database.

### JF 5.1-5.6 : Apply structured problem solving techniques and logical thinking to solve problems and use creativity and resourscefulness to create solutions to obstacle

- I demonstrated this job function while working on multiple projects at American Express. I used problem-solving techniques on a variety of problems. As well as using the proper methodologies to ensure the solutions are bug-free and working correctly. I identified the appropriate test scenarios along with edge cases and used Junit and Mockito to create effective unit tests. 
- The result of my actions were meaningful contributions to my team and solved problems with proper unit tests.
- This competency is connected to this project by having tested the whole functionality of the application with end-to-end testing. As well as writing clean, maintainable code.
