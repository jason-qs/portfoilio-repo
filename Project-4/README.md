 ## Project #4

 https://github.com/jason-qs/kotlin-game

 Overview
 - This is a side project I made to explore what is possible to be built with the Kotlin programming language. It is built with Korge, a multiplatform game engine that is written in Kotlin. The project is a 2D platformer where the main objective is to reach the end of the level while avoiding enemies

 - The use of this project is to make a fun simple 2D platformer. It implements features such as movement mechanics, enemies, and fluid movement. 

 - I wanted to make this fun little game because I wanted to research how other types of applications are built. 

 ## Technologies
- Kotlin
- Korge

## Competencies

### JF 1.1-1.7 : Explain and implement the process of building and deploying software across the Software 

- I demonstrated this job function at American Express by following guidance and working collaboratively on projects. 
- The actions I took were pair coding with colleagues to work collaboratively on projects, explaining to my team pieces of code I built, and working independently on stories to build functions that fit the proper requirements
- The results of my actions were functional features in projects, increased test coverage, and completing stories to the proper specifications. I increased my exposure to software development and the steps required to build a project
-  This competency is connected to the project in the following ways; I researched what the life cycle for a game like this would be. Use a suitable development methodology to tackle this type of project. As well as reach the right technical software expectations.

### JF 2.1-2.8 : Take a Businees or User problem, gather data to analyze the problem and use prototyping tools to create a high fidelity wireframe and UI framework, test the application, and use agile project management

- I demonstrated this job function while working on a prototype in American Express for a specific application to verify that a database migration was successfully completed. The steps I took were to figure out the user needs and technical requirements, create a mockup wireframe of the UI, and build a prototype of the project built with React.
- The result of my actions were increased competency in what steps are required in solving a business problem, as well as a prototype that showcases a solution that will help American Express solve a business problem
- This competency is connected to this project because I had to research what the technical requirements were, create mockup designs, and then implement features into the application.
