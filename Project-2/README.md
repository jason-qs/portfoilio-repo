 ## Project #2

https://github.com/jason-qs/CI-CD-Project

 Overview
 - This is a full stack app that with a Quarkus backend built with Kotlin, and a React framework built with JavaScript

- The use of this project is to leave review to any movie you've seen, as well see the reviews of other users

 - Some important features are Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) this is a way to allow some users such as admin to have access to certain endpoints while not exposing them to regular users. An instance of Keycloak is configured with the project to manage the security and creation of users. It also implements OIDC for authorization. It implements Github actions for automatic testing when pushed to the main branch

## Competencies
### JF 2.1-2.8 : Take a Businees or User problem, gather data to analyze the problem and use prototyping tools to create a high fidelity wireframe and UI framework, test the application, and use agile project management

- I demonstrated this job function while working on a prototype in American Express for a specific application to verify that a database migration was successfully completed. The steps I took were to figure out the user needs and technical requirements, create a mockup wireframe of the UI, and build a prototype of the project built with React.
- The result of my actions were increased competency in what steps are required in solving a business problem, as well as a prototype that showcases a solution that will help American Express solve a business problem
- This competency is connected to this project because I had to analyze a problem and then take the proper steps to make a well designed User Interface built with React


### JF 3.1-3.8 : 3.1-3.8 : Apply the process of server-side development, including explaining algorithms, logic and data structures, can develop and maintain databases and codebases, and explain and implement APIs

- I demonstrated this job function in this specific project as well during my employment at American Express. I worked on multiple server-side projects where I worked with codebases of varying sizes as well as different databases. In these projects, I had to connect to different Rest APIs, make sure data was encrypted, and use the proper data structures and logic to safely handle all the data
- The result of my actions was a meaningful contribution to my team and company. I also gained experience working with large codebases, server-side logic, and how encryption works
- This competency is connected to this project because I built a Quarkus backend that implements encryption, is a RESTful API, server-side logic, and connects to a Database

### JF 4.1-4.8 :  Manage and deploy applications and programs, conduct testing, and adhere to industry security standards

- I demonstrated this job function while working on multiple projects during my employment at American Express. I created numerous unit tests across different projects to ensure the code I wrote was functioning to its requirements. Also, creating a Jenkins pipeline to prepare a project for continuous integration and continuous deployment. The following steps were taken to ensure the codebase was properly maintained. Using Junit and Mockito to create Unit tests. Ensure code is built to the right standard. As well as identifying the correct test scenarios and testing those scenarios
- The result of my actions was ensuring codebases were maintained correctly, and all further developments had unit tests created to ensure code quality. And having more insight into how applications are tested and deployed
- This competency is connected to this project because I created unit tests as well as a GitHub workflow to run tests when a change is pushed to GitHub automatically

### JF 5.1-5.6 : Apply structured problem solving techniques and logical thinking to solve problems and 

- I demonstrated this job function while working on multiple projects at American Express. I used problem-solving techniques on a variety of problems. As well as using the proper methodologies to ensure the solutions are bug-free and working correctly. I identified the appropriate test scenarios along with edge cases and used Junit and Mockito to create effective unit tests. 
- The result of my actions were meaningful contributions to my team and solved problems with proper unit tests.
- This competency is connected to this project by having been tested with the correct test scenarios, along with having unit tests created to ensure the project is functioning as intended
