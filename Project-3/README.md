## Competencies

### JF 6.1-6.7: Demonstrates key professional skills, including using strong communication skills, working collaboratively, and taking initiative to learn and developm professionally

- I demonstrated this job function while working with my team at American Express. I communicated regularly with my colleagues and attended daily standups. At those standups, I gave daily progress on stories and asked for guidance when I encountered an issueâ€”providing input on software design in meetings.
- My actions were attending meetings, communicating effectively with colleagues, and researching solutions for problems I am facing. 
- The result of my actions was increased productivity, more collaboration, and solving problems I have been facing.
- This competency is connected to the project by showing collaboration with the Github project board and being able to work independently to build the necessary parts of the project.

### JF 1.1-1.7 : Explain and implement the process of building and deploying software across the Software Development Life Cycle and Project Life Cycle and describe how thei role contributes to their team and organization

- I demonstrated this job function at American Express by following guidance and working collaboratively on projects. 
- The actions I took were pair coding with colleagues to work collaboratively on projects, explaining to my team pieces of code I built, and working independently on stories to build functions that fit the proper requirements
- The results of my actions were functional features in projects, increased test coverage, and completing stories to the proper specifications. I increased my exposure to software development and the steps required to build a project
- This competency is connected to the project in the following ways, I needed to work collaboratively with others working on the project. Consistently write code with other teammates. As well as dividing up the work equally between other people and taking responsibility for my part of the project, as shown on the project board.

### JF 2.1-2.8 : Take a Businees or User problem, gather data to analyze the problem and use prototyping tools to create a high fidelity wireframe and UI framework, test the application, and use agile project management

- I demonstrated this job function while working on a prototype in American Express for a specific application to verify that a database migration was successfully completed. The steps I took were to figure out the user needs and technical requirements, create a mockup wireframe of the UI, and build a prototype of the project built with React.
- The result of my actions were increased competency in what steps are required in solving a business problem, as well as a prototype that showcases a solution that will help American Express solve a business problem.
- This competency is connected to this project because I had to analyze a problem and then take the proper steps to make a well designed User Interface built with React.
